# Mynah UI
### *A Data & Event Drivent Chat Interface Library for Browsers and Webviews*

### [Live Demo](https://aws.github.io/mynah-ui/)
### [API Docs](https://aws.github.io/mynah-ui/api-doc/index.html)

As you can understand from the title too, **Mynah UI** is a **_data and event_** driven chat interface for browsers and webviews on IDEs or any platform which supports latest web technologies which is also used by Amazon Q for [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.aws-toolkit-vscode) and [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11349-aws-toolkit--amazon-q-codewhisperer-and-more) comes together with AWS Toolkit extension.

Since it is not depending on any framework or a UI library, you can use it inside any web based project without a hassle. Reason behind that decision is to keep it highly configurable for theming to support various use cases. It works standalone, you just need to tell it where to render on the DOMTree.
