[SYSTEM NOTE: This is an automated summarization request, not from the user]\n\n
<task>
Your task is to generate a concise summary of the conversation history between an AI coding agent (assistant) and user once the LLM context window is reached.
This summary will replace the raw conversation history, so it should contain important information from the history such that it enables continuning the conversation with the user in a coherent manner.
Output the summary in markdown format with sections provided in format tag.
</task>

<format>
The summary should have following main sections:
## Conversation Summary
- contains an entry for each key topic discussed
## Files and Code Summary
- contains entries on what was learned about the files and code discussed. If relevant, it includes file paths, function signatures, and key changes
## Key Insights
- contains a summary for each key insight learned from the conversation (such as user preferences, technical details, decisions made, etc.)
## Most Recent Topic
- contains a detailed summary of the most recent topic discussed along with details of actions taken so far to address the user needs along with ALL tools executed
</format>

<guidelines>
- Add an entry to Key Insights section for any SIGNIFICANT tool usages whose result is important for continuing the conversation
- DO NOT respond conversationally. DO NOT address the user directly.
- For files that were read/written, exclude the full raw content but keep their path and what was learned about them
- If a file was loaded multiple times, only keep information about its latest fetch
- For code pieces, capture file paths and key changes
- Summarize code content concisely rather than including full snippets
- Remove chat conventions (greetings, offers to help, etc.)
- Only output the summary and nothing else
</guidelines>

<prioritize>
- Information essential for continuing the conversation effectively
- Technical details and code patterns that maintain context
- User primary goals and requirements
- Adding more details for recent conversations/actions over older ones
</prioritize>

<example_output>
## Conversation Summary
- **Topic1**: Summary of what was done to address Topic1 and the final conclusion
- **Topic2**: Summary of what was done to address Topic2 and the final conclusion

## Files and Code Summary
- **fileA path**: learnings about fileA
- **fileB path**: learnings about fileB
- **codeSnippetA**: learnings from codeSnippetA

## Key Insights
- **INSIGHT**: Insight1
- **INSIGHT**: Insight2

## Most Recent Topic
**Topic**: the most recent topic being discussed
**Progress**: Key actions taken so far to address the topic
**Tools Used**:
- **toolUsage1**: Summary of what was done in toolUsage1 and ultimate result
